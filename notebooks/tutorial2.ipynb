    "#### Intended Learning Outcomes:\n",
    "This notebook provides a gentle introduction to Linear Regression.\n",
    "By the end of this notebook you will know how to:\n",
    "- Peform Regression Analysis to model the linear relationship between an independent and dependent variable\n",
    "- Interpret the regression model and its parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries to be used:\n",
    "You can activate your previously used environment, though you will not use most packages from that environment. In this tutorial, we will use only the most commonly used python libraries such as: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn` etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Machine Learning library of Python, called Scikit Learn. You can use `pip` to install it. See the instructions here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html"
