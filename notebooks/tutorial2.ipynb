    "Now, one bottleneck of their (LexNLP's) approach is that you can't extract **multiple** types of elements at once in a given contract. For each type of element, you must import the corresponding module and call the proper function. That is why, to make our life easier (reason for living of any computer scientist), we have implemented a small utility function on top of LexNLP that allows to extract one **or** several types of elements at once in a given contract. The utility function file is available on the GitHub page of the course here: https://github.com/maastrichtlawtech/law3027-advanced-legal-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/utils.py\n",
