    "#### Intended Learning Outcomes:\n",
    "By the end of this notebook you will know how to:\n",
    "- compute the Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "- generate cross-tabulation/contingency tables\n",
    "- interpret the results of exploratory data analysis with respect to a target variable\n",

    "#### Libraries to be used:\n",
    "You can activate your previously used environment, though you will not use most packages from that environment. In this tutorial, we will use only the most commonly used python libraries such as: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn` etc. "
